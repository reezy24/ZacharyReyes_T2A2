# [R7-8] Purpose
In game development, specifically indie game development, a common issue is finding people to work with. Generally you specialise in one area and need help in others. For example, when developing games, I focus on programming and need to source maps, assets, art, music, etc. externally. The current way to do this is to browse freelancing sites such as Fiverr and Upwork, view social media pages such as Facebook and Twitter feeds, or look through the credits of other games. This app aims to simplify the process by providing a single platform for programmers, musicians, artists, animators, and modellers to work on others' games and source workers for their own games. 

This is an issue as it's very likely that a lot of great game ideas never come to fruition, simply due to not having been able to find the right people for the job.

So, I am a game developer who has just found gamevelop.net
I have this project that I am working on, but I only program.
I need asset makers, map makers, animators, artists and musicians. 
I land on the website, and immediately see the words "Build a Game Development Team, browse game creatives below"
I see the filter option and select the relevant fields
I then browse the different profiles which are presented to me in a grid of profile summaries
I click on the ones I am interested in
On each profile I can see the person's work, a little bit about themselves, their photo, and a button to contact / request to hire
For the people that I find suitable, I click hire
The website tells me that I first need to create a project.
I click on "create project"
I fill in the requested fields - project title, positions required, estimated duration, estimated budget, photos, interview questions PER POSITION etc.
I click create
The website asks me to signup to finalise
Finally, I am redirected to the hire page for the person I want to hire
I select the project I want to hire them for
I send them a personalised message about why I chose them, etc. 
I add any extra interview questions
I send the hire request
I repeat this process for a number of candidates in each position
(a little while later)
I compare the responses to all my hire requests
I select "hire" for the ones that showed interest and are optimal

I started off by listing the pages I need. It's not a complete list, I just needed something that I could refer to to get started with sketches.
